	<p>Hi there, just wanted to check in to see how your ebook production was going. I noticed there hasn't been much activity in the Github repo lately. Are you continuing to make progress?</p>
	<p>The toolset has had several updates recently. You can update it by running `pipx upgrade standardebooks`.</p>
	<p>Let me know how things are coming along!</p>
