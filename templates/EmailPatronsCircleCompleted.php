<p><? if($ebooksThisYear > 0){ ?>In that year, our volunteers produced <?= number_format($ebooksThisYear) ?> new free ebooks. We need the financial support of literature lovers like you in order to keep up that pace.<? }else{ ?>We need the financial support of literature lovers like you in order to keep producing free ebooks.<? } ?> <em>Your membership in our Patrons Circle is what makes Standard Ebooks possible.</em></p>
