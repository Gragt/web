		<h1>Producing an Ebook for Standard Ebooks</h1>
		<p>Our tools and processes are all open source, so anyone with the right technical and editorial knowledge can produce a new Standard Ebooks ebook!</p>
		<p>Here’s what the process of getting an ebook on Standard Ebooks looks like.</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Review the <a href="/contribute/collections-policy">kinds of ebooks we do and don’t accept</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Find a good first production in our <a href="/contribute/wanted-ebooks">Wanted Ebooks list</a>, or if there’s nothing there that interests you, find a straightforward prose work of no longer than about 100,000 words, without much complex formatting like poetry, letters, tables, diagrams, or illustrations.</p>
				<p>We ask this of first producers because our production process is complex and detail-oriented. Producers who start on longer work often abandon the attempt, and even if they succeed, first productions are very error-prone; long works thus become a burden on the reviewer.</p>
				<p>After your first production is complete, you can move on to working on longer or more complex works.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Contact the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/standardebooks">Standard Ebooks mailing list</a> to pitch the ebook you’ve selected, <em>before you begin production</em>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Carefully review the entirety of the <a href="/manual">Standard Ebooks Manual of Style</a>.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Once we’ve OK’d your selection and you’ve read the style manuals, you can get started! Follow the steps in our <a href="/contribute/producing-an-ebook-step-by-step">step-by-step guide to producing an ebook</a> to take your ebook from start to finish.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Once you’ve finished your ebook and completed a complete cover-to-cover proofread, contact the <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/standardebooks">Standard Ebooks mailing list</a> and we’ll assign a reviewer to review your work.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Most first productions have a significant amount of errors. Not to worry! Once you’ve fixed them, contact the mailing list again.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Your ebook will be released! Congratulations, and now it’s time for others to enjoy the fruits of your hard work!</p>
			</li>
